# History



## The past

### Childhood

We brainstormed with [IIT](https://iit.it) during our School Internship. Our will was to take part in [OR](https://www.olimpiadirobotica.it/) competition, and so we had to follow their theme:

> The competition is dedicated to the conception, design and construction of prototypes of robots in order to carry out functions useful for the improvement of the environmental conditions of our planet and/or of the conditions of man's life on it.

Hence, we decided to work on people habits while driving, with a fast and amusing [**ecological race game**](https://ers-eco-race-simulator.github.io/Docs/#/).



### Teenage

During our first team meeting, we opted for a [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) approach. We created some [L&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) [frameworks](https://github.com/ERS-Eco-Race-Simulator), then tested them on an [AlphaBot](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/AlphaBot). After their success we moved on [Yoda](https://github.com/FrancescoGiraud0/Yoda), a project by our Senior that was built last year for an [IIT](https://iit.it) collaboration.



## The future

### Fully-grown 

We will then look for our ["favorite"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony) science: Mechanics. We will build our steering system and assemble our land Rover. We will then test it in various environment and build a beautiful UI around him.

This will be the time for competition: in April we will compete in [OR](https://www.olimpiadirobotica.it/), in Genoa, and hopefully make it to the final!



### Old-age

We have big dream for our project: 

+ Multi-user race
+ Web platform with user and role-play strategy
+ [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/42.088/12.564) [API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmapi) Integration for dynamics path creation.
+ Million and million of people learning how to drive in a ecological way.
