# Some tech we like to use
We, as robotics students, are deeply involved into technological devices and interfaces. Here are some of them, which we like to use!

## [Web](web/web.md)
The `web` as a network between devices allows us to create **modern and fast interfaces**.

## [Lidar](lidar/lidar.md)
`Lidar` is a surveying method that measures distance to a target by illuminating the target with **laser light** and measuring the reflected light with a sensor.

## [Arduino](arduino/arduino.md)
We like `Arduino` as an **open source project**, for its **simplicity** and the **opportunities** it offers non-electronics students like us to approach **electronics**.
