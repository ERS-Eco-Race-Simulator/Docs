### CO2 Emissions

The emissions of CO2 related to fossil fuels continue to raise, despite UE's and world's obligations. Together with CFC and nitrogen oxide, they create greenhouse effect, raising world heating, destroying ecosystem's balance. A great portion of these emissions are caused by vehicle fuel combustion, and 60% of these emissions comes from cars.



### UE's Picture

UE's always worked on reducing CO2 emissions. Kyoto protocol, in far 1997, tried to implement the objective of the UNFCCC to reduce the onset of global warming, by reducing greenhouse gas and, among others,  CO2. However,  it took the world almost 15 years to effectively start improving. Still, we haven't reached the "level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system" that the original creator wished for.

UE's new plans set car's CO2 emissions to  95 g/km. It is the most severe limit ever imposed, so biggest car manufacturers forced to shift the limitation to the begin of 2021. By 2030, emissions level should be reduced to 59 g/km, near the half of what is today's average.



### ERS 

We, as student, realized we can't change the state of art of tech and research, we can only hope to change people mind, how they see and use these tech.

The aim of our project is to raise awareness on the theme of ecology. We host real-word races, were the winner is fast and ecologically sustainable.
